            <h2 id=title-info>Here's a time line of Dr. Stephen Hawking's life.</h2><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Jan 8, 1942</b> Birth. Stephen Hawking was born in Oxford, England, 300 years after Galileo died.

                <li><b>Jan 1, 1959</b> Stephen Hawking attended Oxford University at age 17.
                </li><br>
                <li><b> Jan 1, 1963</b> Disease. Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with ALS disease at age 21,
                    the same disease that the famous baseball player Lou Gehrig was diagnosed with.</li> <br>
                <li><b>Jan 1, 1965</b>Stephen Hawking marries Jane Hawking at age 23.
                </li><br>
                <li><b>Jan 1, 1968</b> Hawking is made a member of the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, when he was
                    46.</li><br>
                <li><b>1970</b> Hawking discovered the second law of black hole dynamics that the event horizon of a
                    black hole can never
                    get smaller. Along with, James M. Bardeen and Brandon Carter, he proposed the four laws of black
                    hole mechanics.</li><br>
                <li><b>1973</b> Stephen Hawking joined the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics at
                    Cambridge.
                    In the same year he discovers, to his disbelief, that black holes could leak energy and particles
                    into space,
                    and even explode in a fountain of high-energy sparks.</li><br>
                <li><b>Jan 1, 1974</b> Stephen Hawking was made a member of the Royal Society at age 32.</li><br>
                <li><b>1979</b> Appointed Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge (a chair held by Sir Isaac
                    Newton in 1663).
                    Elected as a fellow of the Royal Society.</li><br>

                    which became an instant bestseller book. He was 46.</li><br>
                <li><b>2004</b> Hawking announces that he has solved the Black Hole paradox, which has been a troubling
                    scientists for years.
                    He presents his most recent findings at the international conference on general relativity and
                    gravitation in Dublin.</li><br>
                <li><b> Mar 14, 2018</b> Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018, in his home peacefully.</li>
